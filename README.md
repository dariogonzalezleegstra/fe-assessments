# Front-end assessments
A collection of front-end assessment tasks

## Patchwork
The code for this task can be found in the `patchwork` folder.
You can run the app with `npm run patchwork`. Then go to `http://localhost:9001`. 
Unfortunately there are still some bugs in the code. There are at least 21 things you
 can fix or improve. You only have to look inside the `patchwork` folder and you can ignore
the `.storybook` config folder.
